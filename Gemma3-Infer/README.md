We modify LLaMA-Factory(https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) for SFT and vllm infer.

``scripts_raft'' folder contains some shell scripts related to the RAFT process under different settings, and you can refer to the called .py files (mainly in the ``src_raft'' folder).

``scripts_eval'' folder contains some shell scripts related to evaluation on downstream benchmarks (MathVista and MathVerse), and you can refer to the called .py files (mainly in the ``src_eval'' folder).
